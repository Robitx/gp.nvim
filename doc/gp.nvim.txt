==============================================================================
1. Goals and Features                             *gp.nvim-goals-and-features*

The goal is to extend Neovim with the **power of GPT models in a simple
unobtrusive extensible way.** Trying to keep things as native as possible -
reusing and integrating well with the natural features of (Neo)vim.

- **Streaming responses**
    - no spinner wheel and waiting for the full answer
    - response generation can be canceled half way through
    - properly working undo (response can be undone with a single `u`)
- **Infinitely extensible** via hook functions specified as part of the config
    - hooks have access to everything in the plugin and are automatically registered as commands
    - see |gp.nvim-5.-configuration| and |gp.nvim-extend-functionality| sections for details
- **Minimum dependencies** (`neovim`, `curl`, `grep` and optionally `sox`)
    - zero dependencies on other lua plugins to minimize chance of breakage
- **ChatGPT like sessions**
    - just good old neovim buffers formated as markdown with autosave and few buffer bound shortcuts
    - last chat also quickly accessible via toggable popup window
    - chat finder - management popup for searching, previewing, deleting and opening chat sessions
- **Instructable text/code operations**
    - templating mechanism to combine user instructions, selections etc into the gpt query
    - multimodal - same command works for normal/insert mode, with selection or a range
    - many possible output targets - rewrite, prepend, append, new buffer, popup
    - non interactive command mode available for common repetitive tasks implementable as simple hooks
        (explain something in a popup window, write unit tests for selected code into a new buffer,
        finish selected code based on comments in it, etc.)
    - custom instructions per repository with `.gp.md` file
        (instruct gpt to generate code using certain libs, packages, conventions and so on)
- **Speech to text support**
    - a mouth is 2-4x faster than fingers when it comes to outputting words - use it where it makes sense
        (dicating comments and notes, asking gpt questions, giving instructions for code operations, ..)
- **Image generation**
    - be even less tempted to open the browser with the ability to generate images directly from Neovim

2. Install                                                   *gp.nvim-install*


1. INSTALL THE PLUGIN                          *gp.nvim-1.-install-the-plugin*

Snippets for your preferred package manager:

>lua
    -- lazy.nvim
    {
        "robitx/gp.nvim",
        config = function()
            require("gp").setup()
    
            -- or setup with your own config (see Install > Configuration in Readme)
            -- require("gp").setup(config)
    
                -- shortcuts might be setup here (see Usage > Shortcuts in Readme)
        end,
    }
<

>lua
    -- packer.nvim
    use({
        "robitx/gp.nvim",
        config = function()
            require("gp").setup()
    
        -- or setup with your own config (see Install > Configuration in Readme)
        -- require("gp").setup(config)
    
            -- shortcuts might be setup here (see Usage > Shortcuts in Readme)
        end,
    })
<

>lua
    -- vim-plug
    Plug 'robitx/gp.nvim'
    
    require("gp").setup()
    
    -- or setup with your own config (see Install > Configuration in Readme)
    -- require("gp").setup(config)
    
    -- shortcuts might be setup here (see Usage > Shortcuts in Readme)
<


2. OPENAI API KEY                                  *gp.nvim-2.-openai-api-key*

Make sure you have OpenAI API key. Get one here
<https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys> and use it in the
|gp.nvim-4.-configuration|. Also consider setting up usage limits
<https://platform.openai.com/account/billing/limits> so you won’t get
suprised at the end of the month.

The OpenAI API key can be passed to the plugin in multiple ways:

  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Method           Example                                                        Security
                                                                                  Level
  ---------------- -------------------------------------------------------------- -------------
  hardcoded string openai_api_key: "sk-...",                                      Low

  default env var  set OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable in shell config        Medium

  custom env var   openai_api_key = os.getenv("CUSTOM_ENV_NAME"),                 Medium

  read from file   openai_api_key = { "cat", "path_to_api_key" },                 Medium-High

  password manager openai_api_key = { "bw", "get", "password", "OAI_API_KEY" },   High
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If `openai_api_key` is a table, Gp runs it asynchronously to avoid blocking
Neovim (password managers can take a second or two).


3. MULTIPLE PROVIDERS                          *gp.nvim-3.-multiple-providers*

The following LLM providers are currently supported besides OpenAI:

- Ollama <https://github.com/ollama/ollama> for local/offline open-source models. The plugin assumes you have the Ollama service up and running with configured models available (the default Ollama agent uses Llama3).
- GitHub Copilot <https://github.com/settings/copilot> with a Copilot license (zbirenbaum/copilot.lua <https://github.com/zbirenbaum/copilot.lua> or github/copilot.vim <https://github.com/github/copilot.vim> for autocomplete). You can access the underlying GPT-4 model without paying anything extra (essentially unlimited GPT-4 access).
- Perplexity.ai <https://www.perplexity.ai/pro> Pro users have $5/month free API credits available (the default PPLX agent uses Mixtral-8x7b).
- Anthropic <https://www.anthropic.com/api> to access Claude models, which currently outperform GPT-4 in some benchmarks.
- Google Gemini <https://ai.google.dev/> with a quite generous free range but some geo-restrictions (EU).
- Any other "OpenAI chat/completions" compatible endpoint (Azure, LM Studio, etc.)

Below is an example of the relevant configuration part enabling some of these.
The `secret` field has the same capabilities as `openai_api_key` (which is
still supported for compatibility).

>lua
        providers = {
            openai = {
                endpoint = "https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions",
                secret = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"),
            },
    
            -- azure = {...},
    
            copilot = {
                endpoint = "https://api.githubcopilot.com/chat/completions",
                secret = {
                    "bash",
                    "-c",
                    "cat ~/.config/github-copilot/hosts.json | sed -e 's/.*oauth_token...//;s/\".*//'",
                },
            },
    
            pplx = {
                endpoint = "https://api.perplexity.ai/chat/completions",
                secret = os.getenv("PPLX_API_KEY"),
            },
    
            ollama = {
                endpoint = "http://localhost:11434/v1/chat/completions",
            },
    
            googleai = {
                endpoint = "https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/{{model}}:streamGenerateContent?key={{secret}}",
                secret = os.getenv("GOOGLEAI_API_KEY"),
            },
    
            anthropic = {
                endpoint = "https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages",
                secret = os.getenv("ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"),
            },
        },
<

Each of these providers has some agents preconfigured. Below is an example of
how to disable predefined ChatGPT3-5 agent and create a custom one. If the
`provider` field is missing, OpenAI is assumed for backward compatibility.

>lua
        agents = {
            {
                name = "ChatGPT3-5",
                disable = true,
            },
            {
                name = "MyCustomAgent",
                provider = "copilot",
                chat = true,
                command = true,
                model = { model = "gpt-4-turbo" },
                system_prompt = "Answer any query with just: Sure thing..",
            },
        },
<


4. DEPENDENCIES                                      *gp.nvim-4.-dependencies*

The core plugin only needs `curl` installed to make calls to OpenAI API and
`grep` for ChatFinder. So Linux, BSD and Mac OS should be covered.

Voice commands (`:GpWhisper*`) depend on `SoX` (Sound eXchange) to handle audio
recording and processing:

- Mac OS: `brew install sox`
- Ubuntu/Debian: `apt-get install sox libsox-fmt-mp3`
- Arch Linux: `pacman -S sox`
- Redhat/CentOS: `yum install sox`
- NixOS: `nix-env -i sox`


5. CONFIGURATION                                    *gp.nvim-5.-configuration*

Bellow is a linked snippet with the default values, but I suggest starting with
minimal config possible (just `openai_api_key` if you don’t have
`OPENAI_API_KEY` env set up). Defaults change over time to improve things,
options might get deprecated and so on - it’s better to change only things
where the default doesn’t fit your needs.

CHAT COMMANDS                                          *gp.nvim-chat-commands*


:GpChatNew                                                        *:GpChatNew*

Open a fresh chat in the current window. It can be either empty or include the
visual selection or specified range as context. This command also supports
subcommands for layout specification:

- `:GpChatNew vsplit` Open a fresh chat in a vertical split window.
- `:GpChatNew split` Open a fresh chat in a horizontal split window.
- `:GpChatNew tabnew` Open a fresh chat in a new tab.
- `:GpChatNew popup` Open a fresh chat in a popup window.


:GpChatPaste                                                    *:GpChatPaste*

Paste the selection or specified range into the latest chat, simplifying the
addition of code from multiple files into a single chat buffer. This command
also supports subcommands for layout specification:

- `:GpChatPaste vsplit` Paste into the latest chat in a vertical split window.
- `:GpChatPaste split` Paste into the latest chat in a horizontal split window.
- `:GpChatPaste tabnew` Paste into the latest chat in a new tab.
- `:GpChatPaste popup` Paste into the latest chat in a popup window.


:GpChatToggle                                                  *:GpChatToggle*

Open chat in a toggleable popup window, showing the last active chat or a fresh
one with selection or a range as a context. This command also supports
subcommands for layout specification:

- `:GpChatToggle vsplit` Toggle chat in a vertical split window.
- `:GpChatToggle split` Toggle chat in a horizontal split window.
- `:GpChatToggle tabnew` Toggle chat in a new tab.
- `:GpChatToggle popup` Toggle chat in a popup window.


:GpChatFinder                                                  *:GpChatFinder*

Open a dialog to search through chats.


:GpChatRespond                                                *:GpChatRespond*

Request a new GPT response for the current chat. Usin`:GpChatRespond N` request
a new GPT response with only the last N messages as context, using everything
from the end up to the Nth instance of `🗨:..` (N=1 is like asking a question
in a new chat).


:GpChatDelete                                                  *:GpChatDelete*

Delete the current chat. By default requires confirmation before delete, which
can be disabled in config using `chat_confirm_delete = false,`.


TEXT/CODE COMMANDS                                *gp.nvim-text/code-commands*


:GpRewrite                                                        *:GpRewrite*

Opens a dialog for entering a prompt. After providing prompt instructions into
the dialog, the generated response replaces the current line in normal/insert
mode, selected lines in visual mode, or the specified range (e.g.,
`:%GpRewrite` applies the rewrite to the entire buffer).

`:GpRewrite {prompt}` Executes directly with specified `{prompt}` instructions,
bypassing the dialog. Suitable for mapping repetitive tasks to keyboard
shortcuts or for automation using headless Neovim via terminal or shell
scripts.


:GpAppend                                                          *:GpAppend*

Similar to `:GpRewrite`, but the answer is added after the current line, visual
selection, or range.


:GpPrepend                                                        *:GpPrepend*

Similar to `:GpRewrite`, but the answer is added before the current line,
visual selection, or range.


:GpEnew                                                              *:GpEnew*

Similar to `:GpRewrite`, but the answer is added into a new buffer in the
current window.


:GpNew                                                                *:GpNew*

Similar to `:GpRewrite`, but the answer is added into a new horizontal split
window.


:GpVnew                                                              *:GpVnew*

Similar to `:GpRewrite`, but the answer is added into a new vertical split
window.


:GpTabnew                                                          *:GpTabnew*

Similar to `:GpRewrite`, but the answer is added into a new tab.


:GpPopup                                                            *:GpPopup*

Similar to `:GpRewrite`, but the answer is added into a pop-up window.


:GpImplement                                                    *:GpImplement*

Example hook command to develop code from comments in a visual selection or
specified range.


:GpContext                                                        *:GpContext*

Provides custom context per repository:

- opens `.gp.md` file for a given repository in a toggable window.
- appends selection/range to the context file when used in visual/range mode.
- also supports subcommands for layout specification:
    - `:GpContext vsplit` Open `.gp.md` in a vertical split window.
    - `:GpContext split` Open `.gp.md` in a horizontal split window.
    - `:GpContext tabnew` Open `.gp.md` in a new tab.
    - `:GpContext popup` Open `.gp.md` in a popup window.
- refer to |gp.nvim-custom-instructions| for more details.


SPEECH COMMANDS                                      *gp.nvim-speech-commands*


:GpWhisper                                                        *:GpWhisper*

Transcription replaces the current line, visual selection or range in the
current buffer. Use your mouth to ask a question in a chat buffer instead of
writing it by hand, dictate some comments for the code, notes or even your next
novel..

For the rest of the whisper commands, the transcription is used as an editable
prompt for the equivalent non whisper command - `GpWhisperRewrite` dictates
instructions for `GpRewrite` etc.


:GpWhisperRewrite                                          *:GpWhisperRewrite*

Similar to `:GpRewrite`, but the prompt instruction dialog uses transcribed
spoken instructions.


:GpWhisperAppend                                            *:GpWhisperAppend*

Similar to `:GpAppend`, but the prompt instruction dialog uses transcribed
spoken instructions for adding content after the current line, visual
selection, or range.


:GpWhisperPrepend                                          *:GpWhisperPrepend*

Similar to `:GpPrepend`, but the prompt instruction dialog uses transcribed
spoken instructions for adding content before the current line, selection, or
range.


:GpWhisperEnew                                                *:GpWhisperEnew*

Similar to `:GpVnew`, but the prompt instruction dialog uses transcribed spoken
instructions for opening content in a new vertical split window.


:GpWhisperTabnew                                            *:GpWhisperTabnew*

Similar to `:GpTabnew`, but the prompt instruction dialog uses transcribed
spoken instructions for opening content in a new tab.


:GpWhisperPopup                                              *:GpWhisperPopup*

Similar to `:GpPopup`, but the prompt instruction dialog uses transcribed
spoken instructions for displaying content in a pop-up window.


AGENT COMMANDS                                        *gp.nvim-agent-commands*


:GpNextAgent                                                    *:GpNextAgent*

Cycles between available agents based on the current buffer (chat agents if
current buffer is a chat and command agents otherwise). The agent setting is
persisted on disk across Neovim instances.


:GpAgent                                                            *:GpAgent*

Displays currently used agents for chat and command instructions.


:GpAgent XY                                                      *:GpAgent-XY*

Choose a new agent based on its name, listing options based on the current
buffer (chat agents if current buffer is a chat and command agents otherwise).
The agent setting is persisted on disk across Neovim instances.


IMAGE COMMANDS                                        *gp.nvim-image-commands*


:GpImage                                                            *:GpImage*

Opens a dialog for entering a prompt describing wanted images. When the
generation is done it opens dialog for storing the image to the disk.


:GpImageAgent                                                  *:GpImageAgent*

Displays currently used image agent (configuration).


:GpImageAgent XY                                            *:GpImageAgent-XY*

Choose a new "image agent" based on its name. In the context of images, agent
is basically a configuration for model, image size, quality and so on. The
agent setting is persisted on disk across Neovim instances.


OTHER COMMANDS                                        *gp.nvim-other-commands*


:GpStop                                                              *:GpStop*

Stops all currently running responses and jobs.


:GpInspectPlugin                                            *:GpInspectPlugin*

Inspects the GPT prompt plugin object in a new scratch buffer.


GPDONE AUTOCOMMAND                                *gp.nvim-gpdone-autocommand*

Commands like `GpRewrite`, `GpAppend` etc. run asynchronously and generate
event `GpDone`, so you can define autocmd (like auto formating) to run when gp
finishes:

>lua
        vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd({ "User" }, {
            pattern = {"GpDone"},
            callback = function(event)
                print("event fired:\n", vim.inspect(event))
                -- local b = event.buf
                -- DO something
            end,
        })
<


CUSTOM INSTRUCTIONS                              *gp.nvim-custom-instructions*

By calling `:GpContext` you can make `.gp.md` markdown file in a root of a
repository. Commands such as `:GpRewrite`, `:GpAppend` etc. will respect
instructions provided in this file (works better with gpt4, gpt 3.5 doesn’t
always listen to system commands). For example:

>md
    Use ‎C++17.
    Use Testify library when writing Go tests.
    Use Early return/Guard Clauses pattern to avoid excessive nesting.
    ...
<

Here is another example <https://github.com/Robitx/gp.nvim/blob/main/.gp.md>.


SCRIPTING                                                  *gp.nvim-scripting*

`GpDone` event + `.gp.md` custom instructions provide a possibility to run
gp.nvim using headless (neo)vim from terminal or shell script. So you can let
gp run edits accross many files if you put it in a loop.

`test` file:

>
    1
    2
    3
    4
    5
<

`.gp.md` file:

>
    If user says hello, please respond with:
    
    ```
    Ahoy there!
    ```
<

calling gp.nvim from terminal/script:

- register autocommand to save and quit nvim when Gp is done
- second jumps to occurrence of something I want to rewrite/append/prepend to (in this case number `3`)
- selecting the line
- calling gp.nvim acction

>
    $ nvim --headless -c "autocmd User GpDone wq" -c "/3" -c "normal V" -c "GpAppend hello there"  test
<

resulting `test` file:

>
    1
    2
    3
    Ahoy there!
    4
    5

4. Shortcuts                                               *gp.nvim-shortcuts*

There are no default global shortcuts to mess with your own config. Bellow are
examples for you to adjust or just use directly.


NATIVE                                                        *gp.nvim-native*

You can use the good old `vim.keymap.set` and paste the following after
`require("gp").setup(conf)` call (or anywhere you keep shortcuts if you want
them at one place).

>lua
    local function keymapOptions(desc)
        return {
            noremap = true,
            silent = true,
            nowait = true,
            desc = "GPT prompt " .. desc,
        }
    end

5. Extend functionality                         *gp.nvim-extend-functionality*

You can extend/override the plugin functionality with your own, by putting
functions into `config.hooks`. Hooks have access to everything (see
`InspectPlugin` example in defaults) and are automatically registered as
commands (`GpInspectPlugin`).

Here are some more examples:

- `:GpUnitTests`
    >lua
        -- example of adding command which writes unit tests for the selected code
        UnitTests = function(gp, params)
            local template = "I have the following code from {{filename}}:\n\n"
                .. "```{{filetype}}\n{{selection}}\n```\n\n"
                .. "Please respond by writing table driven unit tests for the code above."
            local agent = gp.get_command_agent()
            gp.Prompt(params, gp.Target.enew, nil, agent.model, template, agent.system_prompt)
        end,
    <
- `:GpExplain`
    >lua
        -- example of adding command which explains the selected code
        Explain = function(gp, params)
            local template = "I have the following code from {{filename}}:\n\n"
                .. "```{{filetype}}\n{{selection}}\n```\n\n"
                .. "Please respond by explaining the code above."
            local agent = gp.get_chat_agent()
            gp.Prompt(params, gp.Target.popup, nil, agent.model, template, agent.system_prompt)
        end,
    <
- `:GpCodeReview`
    >lua
        -- example of usig enew as a function specifying type for the new buffer
        CodeReview = function(gp, params)
            local template = "I have the following code from {{filename}}:\n\n"
                .. "```{{filetype}}\n{{selection}}\n```\n\n"
                .. "Please analyze for code smells and suggest improvements."
            local agent = gp.get_chat_agent()
            gp.Prompt(params, gp.Target.enew("markdown"), nil, agent.model, template, agent.system_prompt)
        end,
    <
- `:GpTranslator`
    >lua
        -- example of adding command which opens new chat dedicated for translation
        Translator = function(gp, params)
          local agent = gp.get_command_agent()
        local chat_system_prompt = "You are a Translator, please translate between English and Chinese."
        gp.cmd.ChatNew(params, agent.model, chat_system_prompt)
        end,
    <
- `:GpBufferChatNew`
    >lua
        -- example of making :%GpChatNew a dedicated command which
        -- opens new chat with the entire current buffer as a context
        BufferChatNew = function(gp, _)
            -- call GpChatNew command in range mode on whole buffer
            vim.api.nvim_command("%" .. gp.config.cmd_prefix .. "ChatNew")
        end,
    <

The raw plugin text editing method `Prompt` has seven aprameters:

- `params` is a |table passed to neovim user commands|, `Prompt` currently uses:
    - `range, line1, line2` to work with |ranges|
    - `args` so instructions can be passed directly after command (`:GpRewrite something something`)
    >lua

- `target` specifying where to direct GPT response
    - enew/new/vnew/tabnew can be used as a function so you can pass in a filetype
        for the new buffer (`enew/enew()/enew("markdown")/..`)
    >lua

- `prompt`
    - string used similarly as bash/zsh prompt in terminal, when plugin asks for user command to gpt.
    - if `nil`, user is not asked to provide input (for specific predefined commands - document this, explain that, write tests ..)
    - simple `🤖 ~` might be used or you could use different msg to convey info about the method which is called
        (`🤖 rewrite ~`, `🤖 popup ~`, `🤖 enew ~`, `🤖 inline ~`, etc.)
- `model`
    - see gpt model overview <https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/overview>
- `template`
    - template of the user message send to gpt
    - string can include variables bellow:
          name            Description
          --------------- -----------------------------------
          {{filetype}}    filetype of the current buffer
          {{selection}}   last or currently selected text
          {{command}}     instructions provided by the user
- `system_template`
    - See gpt api intro <https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/chat/introduction>
- `whisper`
    - optional string serving as a default for input prompt (for example generated from speech by Whisper)
